Scramble is like Boggle, users around the world play a round that lasts 90 seconds.  They are shown a 4 X 4 grid of letters, and they make as many words as they can by entering them in their client software (telnet, for example).  Then the game shows who won that round.

Scramble uses a simple chat server on port 21, accessible with telnet or any nicer client software.  It is hosted at scramblelovers.com

Stats are available with chat commands, and any user can start a game similarly.  The server controls the timing, calculating etc.  This code is mostly the server. 

This is Scramble written in Rust.  

```telnet
 user SunKing2 has enterd (4 players now)
 user cleetus as entered (5 players now)
Cleetus > hi peeps
Cleetus > rd
*** Get ready for a round of Scramble (90 Seconds) ***
C H L E
A T N I
O S U Q
R U S T

> [...elided stuff... I madly type in words, pressing Enter after each one...]

Round has ended... 
Scores: 
SunKing2   .... [score stuff elided]
```

The chat is typical, allowing talking before or during the game, private messaging, and blocking of individual users.
