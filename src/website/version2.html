        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>Scramble ... Play Scramble online, a game similar to Boggle.

        <p>Originally hosted at the Delphi web site, it ran there for decades.
           Delphi discontinued it just before 2000, when SunKing2
           wrote a version in Java with crazyg's scoring scheme.
           It ran online for years, being hosted by dedicated Scramblers.
           It has a 
           <a href="https://forums.delphiforums.com/WSA">forum</a> and
           the official site where the 
           game is hosted 
           is <a href="http://scramblelovers.com">Scramblelovers.com</a>.
